        It was all a dream<br>
        Un, unreachable<br>
        It was all a dream<br>
        It was all a dream<br>
        Unreachable<br>
        It was all a dream<br>
        Un, unreachable<br>

        I don't know what I'ma just say<br>
        I'ma let out everything<br>
        I don't know what I'ma say<br>
        I'ma let out everything<br>
        In a world I don't like<br>
        There ain't too many of my types<br>
        So I just float in the world alone<br>
        In my own head, in my ozone<br>
        In my own head, in my ozone<br>
        I am the pearl, in my own world<br>
        Then they all turn against me<br>
        I become the sacrificial lamb<br>
        To be devoured alive by the stars<br>
        Trodding along, day by day<br>
        In this this world that I did not create<br>
        But in my own, I am wanted on the stake<br>
        So I trod along, and I have no safe place<br>
        And sometimes I just wish I was gay<br>
        But I'm asexual<br>
        Demigods do not love mortals<br>

        Oh, my heart is so weak<br>
        I turn colder day by week<br>
        Nothing excites me<br>
        I am losing my emotions<br>
        Why, why, why do I try so hard<br>
        At it all when it falls and dies and dies<br>
        Cycle, it's a cycle, it's a cycle<br>
        You cannot escape the spiral<br>
        It's a cycle, it's a cycle<br>
        You cannot escape the spiral<br>
        Contort your mind and insides to the spiral<br>
        I can't feel anything except rage<br>
        The god hijacks my body<br>
        And harms, all around me<br>
        All around me, all around me<br>
        All around me, all around me<br>
        All around me, all around me<br>
        All around me, all around me<br>
        All around me, all around me<br>

        I just want to see the walls just fall apart<br>
        Trapped in my own world, I am so alone<br>
        Somedays I just want to end and kill myself<br>
        Have no one to speak to, I just need some help<br>
        I just want to see the walls just fall apart<br>

        My life is such a tragic story<br>
        You will see underneath the stories<br>
        Why was I born here?<br>
        I don't wanna die here<br>

        What's my purpose in this life?<br>
        I thought I've found it<br>
        But is it right?<br>
        My life is such a tragic story<br>
        You will see underneath the stories<br>
